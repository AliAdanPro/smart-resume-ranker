- ⚡ Fast Results - Get rankings in seconds, not hours

## 🧠 AI Algorithms Used

### Core Matching Algorithms
- **Cosine Similarity** - Measures text similarity between resume and job description
- **Fuzzy Logic** - Handles typos and similar words intelligently
- **Neural Embeddings** - Understands meaning and context, not just keywords

### Advanced Analysis Algorithms
- **Knowledge Graph** - Maps relationships between skills and technologies
- **Skill Gap Analyzer** - Identifies missing skills for each candidate
- **Career Predictor** - Predicts candidate growth and potential
- **Genetic Algorithm** - Optimizes matching through evolutionary techniques

### Scoring Algorithms
- **Ensemble Super Accuracy** - Combines all algorithms for best results
- **Experience Transfer** - Evaluates how past experience applies to new roles
- **Innovation Scorer** - Measures creative and problem-solving indicators
- **Persona Matching** - Matches candidate personality to role requirements
- **Ranking Engine** - Final scoring and candidate ordering

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
